# RazorPagesFSharp

The standard Razor Pages template published by Microsoft but converted from a C# project to an F# project. 

To make use of this template just download it or clone it into Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.

If you're using Visual Studio then **F5** should be enough to run the project and have a working website running in your browser.

If you're working in Visual Studio Code you can run the project from the integrated terminal using `dotnet run`.
